      Video games have always been a faniscating part of my life. 
      To me, they can be an interesting way to potray a story or do a fun activity. 
      I plan in the future to have a job connected with the making of a videogame so that I don't feel annoyed at it.

      Now iam learning in a course how to understand the way games are made and overall become well oriented with how 
      the process of creating a project. With that i will be able to get a better grasp on what i think i will be
      most effective at and enjoy doing.

      My favourite types of games are ones that expand on their story and characters with good gameplay mechanics and 
      delightful to look at graphics.
